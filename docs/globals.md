# Error Handling and Global Library Behavior

The functions described in this section of the Silo manual, are those that effect behavior of the library, globally, for any file(s) that are or will be created or opened.
These include such things as error handling, requiring Silo to do extra work to warn of and avoid overwrites, to compute and warn of checksum errors and to compress data before writing it to disk.

## Global and File-level variants

Some behaviors have both *file* level and *global* variants.
For example, see [`DBSetAllowOverwrites()`](#dbsetallowoverwrites) and [`DBSetAllowOverwritesFile()`](#dbsetallowoverwritesfile).

When a file is *opened or *created*, it *inherents* whatever the library's *global* settings are.
However, a file's settings can be adjusted independently from the library's global settings by calling the equivalent `DBSetXxxFile()` methods.

## `DBShowErrors()`

* **Summary:** Set the error reporting mode.

* **C Signature:**

  ```
  void DBShowErrors (int level, void (*func)(char*))
  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  integer function dbshowerrors(level)
  ```


* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `level` | Error reporting `level`. One of `DB_ALL`, `DB_ABORT`, `DB_TOP`, or `DB_NONE`.
  `func` | Function pointer to an error-handling function.


* **Returned value:**

  `DBShowErrors` returns nothing (void).
  It cannot fail.

* **Description:**

  The `DBShowErrors` function sets the `level` of error reporting done by Silo when it encounters an error.
  The following table describes the action taken upon error for different values of `level`.

  Ordinarily, error reporting from the driver (e.g. HDF5 or PDB) library is disabled.
  However, `DBShowErrors` can also control the behavior of error reporting from the driver library.

  Error level value|Error action
  :---|:---
  `DB_ALL`|Show all errors, beginning with the (possibly internal) routine that first detected the error and continuing up the call stack to the application.
  `DB_ALL_AND_DRVR`|Same as `DB_ALL` but also show error messages generated by the underlying driver library (PDB or HDF5).
  `DB_ABORT`|Same as `DB_ALL` except abort is called after the error message is printed.
  `DB_TOP`|(Default) Only the top-level Silo functions issue error messages.
  `DB_NONE`|The library does not handle error messages. The application is responsible for checking the return values of the Silo functions and handling the error.

   For the HDF5 driver, when `level` is set to `DB_ALL_AND_DRVR`, this has the effect of calling [`H5Eset_auto((H5E_auto1_t) H5Eprint1, stderr)`](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/group___h5_e.html#title25) in the HDF5 library.

## `DBSetAllowOverwrites()`
## `DBSetAllowOverwritesFile()`

* **Summary:** Allow library to over-write existing objects in Silo files

  int DBSetAllowOverwritesFile(DBfile *dbfile, int allow)
  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  integer function dbsetovrwrt(allow)
  ```

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | The file for which the over-write property is desired.
  `allow` | Integer value controlling the Silo library's overwrite behavior. A non-zero value sets the Silo library to permit overwrites of existing objects. A zero value disables overwrites. By default, Silo does **not** permit overwrites.

* **Returned value:**

  Returns the previous setting of the value.

* **Description:**

  By default, Silo permits a caller to over-write existing objects in a Silo file.
  However, overwrites are supported in Silo only when the new object involves individual member data that is no bigger than the original member data.
  If this condition is violated (which is sometimes difficult to predict), then behavior is undefined and will likely lead to corrupted data.

  If you suspect you have a case where unintended overwrites are occurring, it can be useful to turn off overwrites.
  Then, you can watch for any errors reported by the Silo library and determine if and where overwrites might be occurring.

  Note that there is currently a bug in the HDF5 driver where overwrites wind up orphaning existing data in the file rather than in fact overwriting that data.
  If the same object is overwritten many times, this could lead to unexpectedly large Silo files due to all the orphaned data.
  An HDF5 tool named [`h5repack`](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_view_tools_edit.html) maybe useful in reclaiming that wasted space.

## `DBSetAllowEmptyObjects()`
## `DBSetAllowEmptyObjectsFile()`

  int DBSetAllowEmptyObjects(int allow)
  int DBSetAllowEmptyObjectsFile(DBfile *file, int allow)
  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  integer function dbsetemptyok(allow)
  ```

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | The file for which the empty object setting is desired.
  `allow` | Integer value indicating whether or not empty objects should be allowed to be created in Silo files. A zero value prevents callers from creating empty objects in Silo files. A non-zero value permits it. By default, the Silo library does **not** permit callers to create empty objects.

* **Returned value:**

  The previous setting of this value is returned.

* **Description:**

  For much of Silo's early history, the `"EMPTY"` keyword convention (see [`DBPutMultimesh()`](./parallel.md#dbputmultimesh)) was sufficient for dealing with cases where callers needed to create multiple, related multi-block objects with missing blocks.
  In fact, in many cases this convention was sufficient for combining variables which by and large existed on different collections of blocks on a common multi-block mesh.

  More recently, the need has arisen for the Silo library to permit callers to instantiate within Silo files actual empty objects; that is Silo objects with no problem-sized data associated with them.
  For example, a point mesh with no points or a ucd variable with no variable arrays.
  This requirement has been driven by the need to scale to larger problems and the use of nameschemes (see [`DBMakeNamescheme()`](./subsets.md#dbmakenamescheme)) in combination with meshes and variables with missing blocks.

  Historically, such an operation has been considered an error by the Silo library and creating such objects was prevented.
  But, that has been largely an overly cautious restriction in Silo to avert anticipated and not necessarily any real problems.
  `DBSetAllowEmptyObjects()` with a non-zero argument enables the Silo library to by-pass these checks.

## `DBForceSingle()`

* **Summary:** Convert all datatype'd data read in read methods to type float

* **C Signature:**

  ```
  int DBForceSingle(int force)
  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  None
  ```

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `force` | Flag to indicate if forcing should be set or not. Pass non-zero to `force` single precision. Pass zero to **not** `force` single precision.

* **Returned value:**

  Zero on success.
  -1 on failure.

* **Description:**

  This setting is global to the whole library and effects subsequent read operations.

  If `force` is non-zero, then any datatype'd arrays are converted on read from whatever their native datatype is to float.
  A datatype'd array is an array that is part of some Silo object struct containing a `datatype` member which indicates the type of data in the array.
  For example, a `DBucdvar` struct has a `datatype` member to indicate the type of data in its var and mixvar arrays.
  Such arrays will be converted on read if `force` here is non-zero.
  However, a `DBmaterial` object struct is *always* integer data.
  There is no datatype member for such an object and so its data will *never* be converted to float on read regardless of the `force` single status set here.

  This function's original intention may have been to convert *only* double precision arrays to single precision on read.
  However, the PDB driver was apparently never designed that way and the PDB driver's behavior sort of established the defacto meaning of `DBForceSingle`.
  Consequently, as of Silo version 4.8 the HDF5 driver obeys these same semantics as well.
  Though, in fact the HDF5 driver was written to support the original intention of `DBForceSingle` and it worked in this (buggy) fashion for many years before real problems with it were encountered.

  This method is typically used by downstream, post-processing tools to reduce memory requirements.
  By default, Silo does not have single precision forcing enabled.
  When it is enabled, only the methods that result in reading of floating point data from a Silo file are effected.
  Finally, note that write methods are **not** effected.

  It might be nice for data producers to also use this method during write.
  That would be a potentially useful enhancement request because it alleviates software developers from having to write the conversion code before handing to Silo.

## `DBSetDataReadMask2()`
## `DBSetDataReadMask2File()`

* **Summary:** Set the data read mask

* **C Signature:**

  ```
  unsigned long long DBSetDataReadMask2(unsigned long long mask)
  unsigned long long DBSetDataReadMask2File(DBfile *dbfile, unsigned long long mask)
  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  None
  ```

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | the file whose read mask is to be set.
  `mask` | The `mask` to use to read data. This is a bit vector of values that define whether each data portion of the various Silo objects should be read.

* **Returned value:**

  DBSetDataReadMask2 returns the previous data read mask.

* **Description:**

  `DBSetDataReadMask2` replaces the now obsolete `DBSetDataReadMask`.

  The `DBSetDataReadMask2` allows the user to set the `mask` that's used to read various large data components within Silo objects.

  Most Silo objects involve a combination of (small) metadata portion and a (potentially very large) data portion.
  The data portion is that part of the object that consists of pointers to potentially large arrays of data.
  These arrays are typically problem-sized but in any event require additional I/O to read.
  By default, the read `mask` is set to `DBAll`.

  Setting the data read `mask` allows for a `DBGetXxx()` call to return only part of the associated object's data.
  With the data read `mask` set to `DBAll`, subsequent calls to `DBGetXxx()` functions return all of the information.
  With the data read `mask` set to `DBNone`, they return only the metadata.
  The `mask` is a bit vector specifying which part of the potentially problem-sized data should be read.

  A special case is found in the `DBCalc` flag.
  Sometimes data is not stored in the file, but is instead calculated from other information.
  The `DBCalc` flag controls this behavior.
  If it is turned off, the data is not calculated.
  If it is turned on, the data is calculated.

  The values that `DBSetDataReadMask` takes as the `mask` parameter are binary-or'ed combinations of the values shown in the following table:

  Mask bit|Meaning
  :---|:---
  `DBAll`|All data values are read. This value is identical to specifying all of the other `mask` bits or'ed together, setting all of the bit values to 1.
  `DBNone`|No data values are read. This value sets all of the bit values to 0.
  `DBCalc`|If data is calculable, calculate it. Otherwise, return `NULL` for that part.
  `DBMatMatnos`|Material numbers (matnos) read by `DBGetMaterial`.
  `DBMatMatnames`|Material names (matnames) read by `DBGetMaterial`.
  `DBMatMatlist`|Zone-by-zone material list read by `DBGetMaterial`.
  `DBMatMixList`|Mixed material information read by `DBGetMaterial`.
  `DBCurveArrays`|Data values of curves read by `DBGetCurve`.
  `DBPMCoords`|Coordinate arrays read by `DBGetPointmesh`.

  `DBCSGMBoundaryNames`|Boundary names read by `DBGetCsgmesh`
  `DBCSGVData`|Var data arrays read by `DBGetCsgvar`
  `DBCSGZonelistZoneNames`|Zone names read by `DBGetCSGZonelist`

  `DBQMGhostZoneLabels`|Ghost zone labels read by `DBGetQuadmesh`
  `DBUMGhostNodeLabels`|Ghost node labels read by `DBGetUcdmesh`
  `DBZonelistGhostZoneLabels`|Ghost zone labels read by `DBGetUcdmesh` and/or `DBGetZonelist`

  Use the `DBGetDataReadMask2` call to retrieve the current data read `mask` without setting one.

  By default, the data read `mask` is set to `DBAll`.
  The data read `mask` effects only the read portion of the Silo API.

## `DBSetEnableChecksums()`

  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  integer function dbsetcksums(enable)

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | The file for which the checksum property should be set
  `enable` | Integer value controlling checksum behavior of the Silo library. See description for a complete explanation.


* **Returned value:**

  Returns the previous setting for checksum behavior.

* **Description:**

  If checksums are enabled, whenever Silo writes data, it will compute checksums on the data in memory and store these checksums with the data in the file.
  Note that during a write call, in no circumstance will Silo re-read data written to confirm it was written correctly (e.g. it gets back what it wrote).
  In other words, Silo will not detect checksum errors on writes.
  It will detect checksum errors only on reads, only if checksums were actually computed and stored with the data when it was written and only when checksums are indeed enabled by the reader.

  If checksums are enabled, whenever Silo reads data *and* the data it is reading has checksums stored in the file, it will compute and compare checksums.
  If the checksums computed on read do not agree with the checksums stored in the file, the Silo call resulting in the data read will fail.
  The error, `E_CHECKSUM`, will be set (See [`DBShowErrors`](#dbshowerrors)).
  Note that because checksums are not checked on write, there is no foolproof way to detect whether a read has failed because the data was corrupted when it was originally written or because the read itself has failed.

  Checksum checks are supported *only* on the HDF5 driver.
  The PDB driver does not support checksum checks.
  Calling `DBCreate()` with checksumming enabled will fail if `DB_PDB` is specified as the driver.
  If checksumming is enabled while any PDB file is opened, the request for checksumming will be silently ignored by all attempts to write or read data from a PDB file.

  In the HDF5 driver, only the data that winds up in HDF5 datasets in the file is checksummed.
  In most applications, this represents more than 99% of all the data the client writes.
  However, it is important to note that when checksumming is enabled, not all data written by Silo is checksummed.
  Various bits of metadata is not checksummed.

  Finally, empirical results show that the resulting files are 1-5% larger and take about 1-5% longer to write when checksumming is enabled.
  This is due primarily to the fact that a different class of HDF5 dataset, called a chunked dataset, is required in order to enable checksumming.

## `DBSetCompression()`

* **Summary:** Set compression options for succeeding writes of Silo data

  ```

* **Fortran Signature:**

  ```
  integer function dbsetcompress(options, loptions)
  ```

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | The file for which compression settings should be set.
  `options` | Character string containing the name of the compression method and various parameters. The method set using the keyword, "METHOD=". Any remaining parameters are dependent on the compression method and are described below.

* **Returned value:**

  Returns the previous value set for compression behavior.

* **Description:**

  Compression is currently supported only on the HDF5 driver.

  Note that the responsibility for enabling compression falls only on the data producer.
  Any Silo clients attempting to read compressed data may do so without concern for whether the data in the file is compressed or not.
  If the data is compressed, decompression will occur automatically during read.
  This is true as long as the Silo library to which the client reading the data was compiled and linked has the necessary decompression code.
  Because writer and reader need not be compiled and linked to the same exact Silo library installation, each could be compiled with differing compression capabilities making it impossible to read data in some situations.

  To the extent possible, the public installations of Silo on LLNL systems have all been enabled with compatible compression features.
  However, because many application developers have taken to creating their own installations of Silo, it is important to consider the effect of disabling (or enabling) various compression features.

  Compression features are controlled by an arbitrary string, whose contents are described in more detail below.
  By default, the Silo library does not have compression enabled.
  A number of different compression techniques are available.
  Some operate in a mesh and variable and data-type agnostic way while others depend on the type of data and sometimes even the type of mesh.

  Some compression settings are global to all compression methods.
  There are two global parameters that control behavior of compression algorithms.
  These must appear in the compression `options` string before any compression-specific parameters.

  The first is the error mode (`"ERRMODE=<word>"` which controls how the Silo library responds when it encounters an error during compression and/or is unable to compress the data.
  The two options for `<word>` are `FALLBACK` or `FAIL`. Including `"ERRMODE=FALLBACK"` in the compression options string tells Silo that whenever compression fails, it should simply fallback to writing uncompressed data.
  Including `"ERRMODE=FAIL"` in the compression `options` string tells Silo to fail the write and return `E_COMPRESSION` error for the operation.

  The second is the minimum compression ratio to be achieved by compressing the data.
  It is specified as `"MINRATIO=<float>"`.
  For example, including `"MINRATIO=2.5"` in the compression options string tells Silo that all data must be compressed by at least a factor of 2.5:1.
  If it is unable the compress by at least this amount, Silo will either fallback or fail the write depending on the `ERRMODE` setting.

  The remaining paragraphs describe compression algorithm specific options.

  GZIP compression
  : is enabled using `"METHOD=GZIP"` in the options string.

    GZIP recognizes the `LEVEL=<int>`, compression parameter.
    The compression level is an integer from 0 to 9, where 0 results in the fastest compression performance but at the expense of lower compression ratios.
    Likewise, a level of 9 results in the slowest compression performance but with possibly better compression ratios.
    If the `"LEVEL=<int>"` keyword does not appear in the options string or specifies invalid values, the default is level one (1).
    The GZIP method of compression is applied independently to float and integer data for all types of meshes and variables.
    It is also guaranteed to be available to all Silo clients.

    When GZIP compression is applied to floating point data, a secondary [HDF5 shuffle](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1_14/group___d_c_p_l.html#ga31e09cb0bf2da2893eed8a72220e6521) filter is also applied to improve compressibilty of the data.

  SZIP compression:
  : is enabled using `"METHOD=SZIP"` in the options string.
    The SZIP compression algorithm is designed specifically for scientific data.
    SZIP recognizes the `BLOCK=<int>`, and `MASK={EC|NN}` parameters.
    The `BLOCK=<int>`, takes an integer value from 0 to 32, which is a blocking size and must be even and not greater than 32, with typical values being 8, 10, 16, or 32.

    This parameter affects the compression ratio; the more values vary, the smaller this number should be to achieve better performance.
    The `MASK=EC` setting, selects entropy coding method, this is best suited for data that has been processed, working best for small numbers.
    The `MASK=NN` setting, selects the nearest neighbor coding method, preprocesses the data then applies the EC method as above.
    The default parameters for SZIP compression are `"METHOD=SZIP BLOCK=4 MASK=NN"`.
    If in a subsequent write operation the value for `BLOCK` is bigger than the total number of elements in a dataset, the write will fail.
    This means that you should take care not to have compression turned on when doing small writes.
    To achieve optimal performance for SZIP compression, it is recommended that one select a value for `BLOCK` that is an integral divisor of the dataset's fastest-changing dimension.
    Note that the SZIP compression encoder *may* be licensed for non-commercial use only while the decoder (e.g. decompression) is unlimited.
    Note that SZIP decompression is **not** guaranteed to be available to all Silo clients; only those for which the Silo library was configured with SZIP compression capability enabled.
    Like GZIP, SZIP compression is applied to float and integer data independently of the types of meshes and variables.

  FPZIP compression
  : is enabled using `"METHOD=FPZIP"` in the options string.
    The FPZIP compression algorithm was developed by [Peter Lindstrom](https://github.com/lindstro) at LLNL and is also designed for high speed compression of regular arrays of data.
    FPZIP recognizes the `"LOSS=0|1|2|3"` parameter which specifies the amount of loss that is tolerable in the result in terms of quarters of full precision.
    For example, `"LOSS=3"` indicates that a loss of 3/4 of full precision is tolerable (resulting in 8 bit floats or 16 bit doubles).
    Note that for data being written from a double precision writer for down stream visualization purposes, visualization tools such as VisIt often enforce single precision data.
    Therefore, specifying a loss of 32 bits here for double precision data could have a dramatic impact on compression and I/O performance with negligible effect in down stream visualization.
    If the `LOSS` parameter is not specified, the default is `LOSS=0`.
    It is possible to build the Silo library without FPZIP compression support.
    So, it is not always guaranteed to exist.

  HZIP compression
  : is enabled using `"METHOD=HZIP"` in the options string.
    The HZIP compression algorithm was developed by [Peter Lindstrom](https://github.com/lindstro) at LLNL and is designed for high-speed compression of unstructured meshes of quad or hex elements and node-centered variables (it does not yet support zone-centered variables) defined on a mesh.
    Before applying this compression method to any given Silo mesh or variable object, the Silo library checks for compatibility with the constraints of the compression algorithm.
    If the mesh or variable object is compatible, the object will be written with compression enabled.
    Otherwise, compression will be silently ignored.
    It is possible to build the Silo library without HZIP compression support.
    So, it is not always guaranteed to exist.

    Note that FPZIP and HZIP compression features are **not** available in a BSD Licensed release of Silo library.
    They are available only in a Legacy licensed release of the Silo library.

  ZFP compression
  : is enabled using `"METHOD=ZFP"` in the options string.
    ZFP compression in the Silo library uses a built-in version of the [H5Z-ZFP](https://h5z-zfp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) compression filter.
    Data compressed with Silo using ZFP is fully compatible with any reader using the H5Z-ZFP compression filter.
    Use `"RATE=<float>"` to set compression mode to use ZFP's rate-based compression.
    Use `"ACCURACY=<float>"` to set compression mode to use ZFP's accuracy-based compression.
    Use `"PRECISION=<int>"` to set compression mode to use ZFP's precision-based compression.
    Use `"EXPERT=<minbits,maxbits,maxprec,minexp>"` to set compression mode to use ZFP's expert compression mode.
    Use `"REVERSIBLE"` to set compression mode to use ZFP's reversible compression.
    Note that all other ZFP related parameters having to do with data type and array dimensions are handled by Silo automatically during each
    `DBPutXxx()` call.

* **Arguments:**

  Arg name | Description
  :---|:---
  `dbfile` | The file for which HDF5 friendly names property should be set
  `enable` | Flag to indicate if friendly names should be turned on (non-zero value) or off (zero).

* **Returned value:**

  Old setting for this flag

* **Description:**

  In versions of Silo prior to 4.8, the default behavior of the HDF5 driver was that it used HDF5 in a way that made the data somewhat UNnatural to the user when viewed with HDF5 tools such as [`h5ls`](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_view_tools_view.html#subsecViewToolsViewContent_h5ls), [`h5dump`](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_view_tools_view.html#subsecViewToolsViewContent_h5dump) and [`hdfview`](https://confluence.hdfgroup.org/display/HDFVIEW/HDFView+3.x+User%27s+Guide) as well as other tools that interact with the data via the HDF5 API.
  This was not a problem for Silo but was a problem for these and other HDF5 tools.

  `DBSetFriendlyHDF5Names()` was introduced as a way to address this issue so that the data in an HDF5 file written by Silo look more *natural* to HDF5.
  Calling `DBSetFriendlyHDF5Names()` with a value of one (`1`) will result in additional HDF5 metadata being added to the file (in the form of soft links) with better names (and locations) for Silo objects' datasets.
  Note that creation of links does increase the file size ever so slightly.
  This affect is less significant for larger files.
  It is also likely to have some negative but as yet to be investigated effect on I/O performance

  Calling `DBSetFriendlyHDF5Names()` with a value of two (`2`) will forgo the creation of soft links and instead write the actual dataset data where those links would have been created (e.g. the current working directory of the Silo file).
  This may be important for files consisting of a large number of objects as it eliminates the creation of the `/.silo` group and subsequent very large number of dataset objects in that one group.

  In versions of Silo 4.8 and newer, the default behavior of the Silo library is to use mode `2`, that is to create the datasets themselves there the links would have otherwise been created.

  If it was not obvious from the name, this method effects only the HDF5 driver.

* **Returned value:**

  The old maximum number of deprecate warnings

* **Description:**

  Some of Silo's API functions have been deprecated.
  Some options on Silo objects have also been deprecated.
  Finally, some conventional arrays, such as `_visit_defvars`, have been deprecated.

  When an attempt to use a deprecated function, option or convention is detected, Silo will issue an error message on `stderr` and proceed normally.
  The default number of error messages any given deprecated function will report on `stderr` is 3.
  Note, this is on a per-deprecated function, option or convention basis.
  If this number is decreased to zero by calling `DBSetDeprecateWarnings(0)`, no warnings will be generated on `stderr`.
  If it is increased, more warnings will be issued.

  Note that deprecated functions, options and conventions are guaranteed to operate correctly only in the first release in which they become deprecated.
  In subsequent releases, they may be removed entirely.
  So, it is wise to run your application for a while without turning off deprecation warnings to get some inventory of functions that require attention.

  Arg&nbsp;name | Description
  :---|:---
  `mode` | Mode to indicate how Silo library should behave for subsequent object creation operations. Pass either `DB_COMPAT_OVER_PERF` or `DB_PERF_OVER_COMPAT`. The default is `DB_COMPAT_OVER_PERF`. See description below for further details.

* **Returned value:**

  Previous setting for `mode`.

* **Description:**

  Silo's compatibility mode influences whether data can be exchanged between producers and consumers using dramatically different versions of Silo or an underlying I/O library such as HDF5 Silo depends on.

  By default, the Silo library operates to *maximize* compatibility of files created between newer and older versions of the library (or an underlying driver library such as HDF5).
  However, doing this may come at the cost of some lost performance.
  Better performance may be possible by using newer versions of Silo (or an underlying driver library such as HDF5) but the resulting data may not be readable by older versions of Silo (or older versions of an underlying driver library such as HDF5).

  Silo's compatibility mode is designed to enable producers and consumers to control the tradeoff between compatibility and performance.
  The compatibility mode can be set globally for the entire library with `DBSetCompatibilityMode()`.
  Alternatively, it can also be set for an individual Silo file when it is OR'd into the `mode` arg in the [`DBCreate`](files.md#dbcreate) or [`DBOpen`](files.md#dbopen) calls.
  When it is OR'd into the `mode` arg, that setting takes precedent over the global setting.
  There is no `DBSetCompatibilityModeFile()` because that requires having an already open file for which compatibility features would have had to have already been chosen.

  When `DB_COMPAT_OVER_PERF` is set (which is also the default), it means that when there is a choice in the way the Silo library behaves, compatibility will be prioritized over performance.
  In this mode, the Silo library endeavours to create data readable by the oldest version of Silo still likely in use (4.10) and/or the oldest version of the HDF5 library Silo is likely to be using (1.8).

  Compatability applies to *entire* files.
  A file written with `DB_PERF_OVER_COMPAT` from a newer Silo and/or HDF5 library may be unreadable by an application using an older Silo and/or HDF5 library.

  :::{tip}
  There are likely circumstances where setting compatibility mode to prioritize performance over compatibility will result in better performance.
  It is difficult to quantify *better* and it will vary based on the particular use-cases.
  However, *better* might be anywhere between 2x and 10x for specific operations.
  :::

  When performance considerations need to take precedence, callers are free to set the compatibility mode to `DB_PERF_OVER_COMPAT` which favors performance over compatibility.
  However, all stakeholders should be made aware that the Silo file may not be readable by applications using older verions of Silo (or older versions of an underlying driver library such as HDF5).

  :::{danger}
  When `DB_PERF_OVER_COMPAT` is in effect (either for an individual file or for the whole library), files written may not be readable by all downstream consumers.
  This is more likely to be true if the data producer is using a newer version of Silo or HDF5 than a consumer and is less likely to be true if the data producer is using and older version of Silo or HDF5 than a consumer.
  In some cases, correcting downstream consumers may involve simply re-linking them with newer versions of Silo and/or HDF5.
  In other cases, correcting downstream consumers may require re-compiling them with newer versions of Silo and/or HDF5.
  :::

  As Silo has evolved, various new features have been introduced either to Silo itself or the underlying driver I/O library Silo uses which can impact the backward compatibility.

  An example of a Silo-level feature that impacted backward compatibility was the introduction of nameschemes for multi-block objects.
  Nameschemes were introduced in such a way that data producers using nameschemes produced files downstream consumers could no longer read correctly without modification.
  This is a bad outcome.
  This is especially true when an alternative would have been to have `DBGetMultiXxx()` methods (the methods that read multi-block objects) expand any nameschemes into the equivalent explicit lists of names thereby obeying the terms of the original, older `DBGetMultiXxx()` interface.
  Concievably, this is something that is possible to handle if `DB_COMPAT_OVER_PERF` is OR'd with `DB_READ` in a [`DBOpen`](files.md#dbopen) call.
  Compatibility mode flags are not currently supported for `DB_READ` opens.

  Nameschemes represent a backward compatibility issue that is restricted to *some* objects (e.g. multi-block objects) in a Silo file.
  Other objects of the Silo file will remain readable by older versions of Silo (or older versions of the underlying driver library such as HDF5).
  An example of a Silo feature that can impact compatibility of the *whole file* is the choice of virtual file driver (VFD).
  In some cases, a data producer can select a virtual file driver (often driven by I/O performance considerations) which can be handled by a data consumer only if the consumer had been previously set up to handle it.
  Any workflow involving a Silo data consumer that was not set up to handle that virtual file driver would not be able to even open the file.

  The above examples underscore a commonly encountered compatibility tradeoff in persistent storage libraries like Silo.
  Compatibility (whether downstream consumers can read the data) is often pitted against performance.
  Best performance often requires data producers to utilize features of libraries that may break backward compatibility meaning downstream consumers using older versions of Silo (or older versions of the underlying driver library such as HDF5) may not be able to read the data without modification.

  These issues extend also to the underlying I/O driver libraries Silo uses such as HDF5.
  Data producers using newer versions of HDF5 underneath Silo and using newer features that offer better performance can produce HDF5 files that downstream consumers may not be able to read without modification.

  When compatibility is broken, in the most ideal cases a consumer may only need to be re-linked against a newer version of Silo and/or HDF5.
  This is the ideal case because it involves a minimum amount of work and can often be restricted to the consumer(s) needing it.
  In other cases, a consumer may need to be re-compiled and re-linked or worse, re-coded, re-compiled and re-linked.
  These latter cases are non-ideal because they often involve repercussions up and down the dependency chain.
  In these cases, no part of the workflow can be fixed until all parts of the workflow are fixed.

* **Returned value:**

  Previous setting for `eval`.

* **Description:**

  When the number of blocks in a multi-block object gets large (say > 10,000), it can wind up taking a lot of memory space and taking a long time to write and read.
  For example, a multi-block object with 50,000 blocks where each block has a file path consisting of 100 characters and a Silo object path of another 100 characters, the list of block names is 10 million characters or 10 mega bytes!
  Typically, however, all the block names are very similar and easily computable using an sprintf-style name generation scheme.

  [Nameschemes](subsets.md#dbmakenamescheme) where introduced as an optimization for this.
  In a `DBmultimesh` object, for example, that uses nameschemes, the `meshnames` member is `NULL`.
  A Silo data consumer that is not prepared for this can wind up `SEGV`'ing when attempting to reference block names.

  The `DBSetEvalNameschemes()` methods allow a consumer to force the Silo library to *evaluate* nameschemes whenever multi-block objects involving them are read.
  This means that when multi-block objects are read and they involve nameschemes, the Silo library will produce what would have been the contents of the list of block names member of a the object and the `file_ns` and `block_ns` members will be `NULL`'d out. 
  This allows consumers to make a one-line change to their code and continue operating as they have before without having to deal with nameschemes.
  Alternatively, consumers can use [individual multi-block object conversion functions](utility.md#dbevalmultimeshnameschemes) directly themselves.

  :::{danger}
  The downside is that forcing the Silo library to evaluate nameschemes when reading multi-block objects involving nameschemes will be slower and will require potentially substantially more memory.
  So, this feature should be used with care.
  :::

  There is no question that introducing [nameschemes](subsets.md#dbmakenamescheme) to Silo created a backward compatibility issue which, in retrospect, could have been easily resolved by introducing this feature along with them and having it on by default.
