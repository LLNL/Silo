As of Version  4.8, July, 2010, the Silo source  code is now available
under the standard BSD Open Source License. See COPYRIGHT file for BSD
notice.

The source code for two  compression libraries which have been part of
previous  releases of  the Silo  library  is  not available  under the
terms of  the BSD Open  Source license. These  are the Hzip  and FPzip
compression libraries.

For this  reason, two different releases  of the Silo  source code are
made available. One  is the BSD Open Source  release identified by the
moniker   'bsd'  in   the  distribution   file  names.   For  example,
silo-4.8-bsd.tar.gz   is  the  name  of a  BSD  Open   Source  release
distribution of Silo.  The other is a non-Open  Source release of Silo
under the  same licensing terms  that all previous releases  have been
made. We call this other release a /legacy/ release.  The legacy terms
are repeated, below, for convenience.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------

The BSD Open Source release  distributions do not contain the Hzip and
FPzip compression libraries while the legacy release distributions do.
This  means any objects  within a  Silo file  containing data  that is
compressed with Hzip  or FPzip from a legacy  distribution will not be
readable  in a BSD  distribution. Since  compression features  must be
explicitly turned on by a  Silo application, this impact can be easily
mitigated by  ensuring that Hzip and FPzip compression are  used  only
for objects within Silo files not intended to be read by BSD releases.

For more  information on availability  of Hzip and  FPzip compression,
contact the developer, Peter Lindstrom, lindstrom2@llnl.gov.
