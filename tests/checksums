# Determine the offset of an hdf5 dataset in the silo file.
# We do this because we can't indescriminently corrupt the file.
# Silo's checksumming is done only on the dataset raw data.
# So, we have to make sure that we corrupt the file somewhere within
# some dataset raw data. We're aiming to corrupt the raw data for
# the facelist object, "fl1" in block 2 in the file by using octal
# dump (od). First, we find a sequence of 4 integers associated with
# that data, 167, 179, 323, 311. 6 facelist objects in multi_ucd3d.h5
# contain this sequence; blocks 2, 11, 14, 23, 26 and 35. And, no other
# raw data contains this sequence. We use octal dump (od) and treat
# the *entire* contents of the file as type d4 (decimal, 4-byte ints)
# and then grep for the sequence of ints we know should exist in the
# file. But, this approach has two issues both having to do with the
# skip at which od begins to a) treat each sequence of 4 bytes as a
# decimal integer and b) treat each sequence of 4 such integers as a
# single line it outputs. In either case, the wrong skip can defeat
# grep logic. However, for the sequence of 4, 4-byte integers, there
# are only 16 unique skips we need to try before we either find a
# match or conclude none exists. So, we loop over successive skips 
# starting from 0 each 1 byte further down the file until we find what
# we're looking for. We then take the *minimum* offset we find as that
# will be associated with the first "fl1" object raw data written to
# the file for block 2.
