# dirname -- "$0" gets the scriptâ€™s directory even if this script is run via a
#     relative path like ../../foo/bar/gorfo.sh.
# The CDPATH= nulls that env. variable and prevents cd from printing anything
#     if CDPATH is set in the environment.
# pwd gives the absolute path after the cd has occurred. This all happens in
#     a subshell so the cwd of the current script is unchanged.
