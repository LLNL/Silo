/* HZIP node order permuation vector construction.
   To construct a permutation vector, work backwards
   from the highest numbered node on the canonical
   element, finding its cooresponding node number on
   the source element. Put the resulting number in
   the highest nibble of the unsigned word for the
   permutation vector. Then, move to the next highest
   numbered node on the canonical element, repeating
   all these steps to arrive at a value for the next
   highest order nibble in the word. 3D example...

  HZIP Compression integration overview...

  HZIP is a unique among compression algorithms in that it is 
  capabable of exploiting mesh structure in order to improve
  performance. However, this means that the compressor needs 
  to maintain information on the mesh connectivity in order to
  compress any variables defined on the mesh. Other compressors
  operate either on raw byte streams or, maybe, multidimensional
  integer and floating point arrays. FPZIP does that for example.
  But, to use HZIP, Silo needs to maintain a cache of recently
  used nodelists. Since Silo imposes no order on how objects are
  written or read, if the writer doen't write in the correct order,
  things will fail. During read, however, the silo library can
  ensure tha all information necessary to decompress is available
  when necessary. 

  The design here attempts to localize as much of the compression
  know how to an HDF5 'filter.' It is best if the compressor is
  properly integrated with HDF5 using HDF5's filter architecture.
  This is substantially easier for generic compressors because
  there isn't any information other than the data stream required
  to compress or decompress. That is not true for HZIP compression.
  The HDF5 filter that implements HZIP compression,
  db_hdf5_hzip_filter_op, must exploit a lot of information apart
  from the actual data stream it is compressing or decompressing.
  This extra information is managed in db_hdf5_hzip_params. In
  a handful of places in the driver, we've had to add code to
  manage HZIP compression information so that the compressor will
  have all the information it needs. These places are the
  PrepareForXXXCompression|Decompression methods.

  There are a number of issues...
  a) HZIP compresses only node-centered data, not zone-centerd.
  b) HZIP compresses only 2D quad meshes or 3D hex meshes.
  c) HZIP is designed for unstructured grid. To use it on structured
     grid, we create a fictitious nodelist at will.
  d) The silo client must call DBFreeResources (which happens
     automatically on DBClose) to free up stored nodelists
     used by HZIP. It is best if the client operate in such a
     way that reads or writes for all variables of a mesh
     occur shortly after the mesh itself and that the client
     does not iterate through a slew of meshes and then the
     variables for those meshes.
  e) To use HZIP, you need to give it a buffer to place the
     compressed result it. But, you can't allocate such a 
     buffer without knowing size. So, we take the approach
     of having a min. compression ratio and allocating a
     (possibly too large) buffer for HZIP to compress into.
     If HZIP cannot compress into this size, it fails and
     we skip the compression. If it can, HDF5 ultimately
     writes only the compressed bytes. Same is true for FPZIP.
  f) To use HDF5 filters, the datasets must be 'chunked.'
     With chunked datasets, HDF5 essentially makes a copy
     of the data on write effecting performance and memory
     usage.
  g) Silo supports data read masks. If you attempt to read
     a mesh without reading its zonelist and the zonelist
     (and mesh) are compressed, then the result will fail
     (presently in unpredictable ways) because HZIP needs
     the nodelist in order to decompress.
  h) In integrating compression, we have to take care that
     new calls introduced to support compression that ALWAYS
     happen (whether we are compressing or not) do not 
     negatively affect performance of the 'old' Silo.
     An example is in PrepareForUcdvarDecompression.
  f) Silex cannot browse HZIP compressed objects because it
     does not operate at the correct level of abstraction. 
     It uses DBGetObject calls only.

 * Function:    build_fspace
 *
 * Purpose:     Build a file data space selection based on the silo OFFSET,
 *              LENGTH, and STRIDE. The COUNT for hdf5 hyperslabs is the
 *              number of times to stride whereas the LENGTH argument
 *              passed in is the number of elements over which we stride.
 *              An example:
 *              
 *                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 *               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Silo: offset=2, stride=2, length=7
 *               | | |X| |X| |X| |X| | |  HDF5: offset=2, stride=2, count=4
 *               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 *
 * Return:      Success:        Data space to be closed later. If SIZE is
 *                              non-null then the number of elements selected
 *                              in each dimension is written to that array.
 *
 *              Failure:        Negative, SIZE is undefined.

 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Sep  8 12:54:39 PDT 2005
 *   Made it permit buf to be NULL in which case it will only create the

 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Apr 19 19:16:11 PDT 2007
 *   Added support for friendly hdf5 dataset names (as soft links)
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Tue Jul 15 22:37:31 PDT 2008
 *   Added 'z' to name and compressionFlags argument to provide control
 *   over mesh-level compresion algorithms. The older (non-z) method 
 *   remains as a stub that simply calls this one with zero for flags.
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Nov  5 16:15:00 PST 2009
 *   Added support for hard links for friendly names too. 
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb  4 11:24:24 PST 2010

 *
 *   Added logic to support a different kind of 'friendly-names' mode
 *   where no datasets are put in the 'LINKGRP' and are instead put
 *   'next to' the objects they bind with. The intention is to eliminate
 *   the one, very, very large '/.silo' group.

 *   Mark C. Miller, Mon Aug  2 15:06:57 PDT 2004
 *   This routine had assumed that any string-valued data member was
 *   specifying the name of a dataset to read. That is not always true.
 *   I modified it to attempt to read a dataset of the given name or
 *   just return the string.
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Wed Apr 20 15:09:41 PDT 2005
 *   Renamed from db_hdf5_GetComponent. Added just_get_dataype argument
 *   and logic to just return data type when requested and avoid 
 *   actual read of data
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Wed Jan 21 16:03:02 PST 2009
 *   Added logic to deal with components that are vectors of tuples 
 *   but where DBGetObject flattens these tuples into groups of related
 *   scalars with digits appended to their names. This fixes a problem
 *   in silex displaying these vector-based components.
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr 28 15:57:43 PDT 2009
 *   Added missing statement to set mnofname = 0 after free'ing it.
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct  6 10:24:01 PDT 2009
 *   Removed call to free(mnofname) and set it to zero. Added logic
 *   to free it just prior to STRDUP'ing it.

 *              Changed how long long global node/zone numbers are supported
 *              from a int (bool), "llong_gnode|zoneno" to an int holding
 *              the actual datatype. The type is assumed int if it its
 *              value is zero or it does not exist. Otherwise, the type is
 *              is whatever is stored in gnznodtype member. 
 *
 *              Mark C. Miller, Tue Jul 27 23:20:27 PDT 2010
 *              Removed odd-ball logic to summarily set min/max index to
 *              zero unless 'calledFromGetUcdmesh'

 *   Mark C. Miller, Mon Feb 14 20:16:50 PST 2005
 *   Added Hack to make HDF5 driver deal with cycle/time same as PDB driver
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Apr 19 19:16:11 PDT 2007
 *   Modifed db_hdf5_compwr interface for friendly hdf5 dataset names
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Jan 17 21:41:52 PST 2008
 *   Fixed missing origin member
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Sat Nov 14 20:28:34 PST 2009
 *   Changed how long long global node/zone numbers are supported
 *   from a int (bool), "llong_gnode|zoneno" to an int holding
 *   the actual datatype. The type is assumed int if it its
 *   value is zero or it does not exist. Otherwise, the type is
 *   is whatever is stored in gnznodtype member. 
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb  4 11:25:00 PST 2010
 *   Refactored logic to handle time, dtime and cycle to a new method,
 *   db_hdf5_handle_ctdt().
