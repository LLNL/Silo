/* File-wide modifications:
 *
 *  Sean Ahern, Mon Mar 3 15:38:51 PST 1997 Rearranged most functions, adding
 *  local storage of the return value, to facilitate instrumenting each
 *  function.  (e.g. timing routines)
 *
 *  Sean Ahern, Thu Apr 29 15:41:27 PDT 1999
 *  Made all function definitions ANSI.  Removed unused local variables.
 *
 *  Jeremy Meredith, Fri May 21 10:04:25 PDT 1999
 *  Added a global _uzl structure.
 *
 *  Brad Whitlock, Mon Apr 8 15:17:17 PST 2002
 *  Changed some headers to allow compilation under windows.
 *
 *  Thomas R. Treadway, Fri Jan  5 13:46:26 PST 2007
 *  Added backward compatible symbols

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Function:    context_switch
 *
 * Purpose:     Many of the DB...() functions take an object name as a
 *              parameter.  The old protocol didn't specify whether the
 *              name could include a path, so some drivers allow one and
 *              other don't.  To fix the problem, each of the API functions
 *              that allow a name will call this routine to change to
 *              the specified directory and will call context_restore()
 *              to change back.
 *
 * Bugs:        This function doesn't protect calls to the other API
 *              directory setting/retrieving functions and thus might
 *              leak memory if one of those calls fail with a non-local
 *              return.
 *
 * Return:      Success:        ptr to the previous context.  This ptr
 *                              should be passed to context_restore().
 *
 *              Failure:        NULL, db_perror called.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *      base         output parameter

 * Routine:  DBSetDataReadMask
 *
 * Purpose:  Set and return the data read mask
 *
 * Programmer:  Sean Ahern, Fri Jan 26 17:28:06 PST 2001
 *
 * Description:  This routine sets the data read mask.  It returns the
 *               previous data read mask.  The data read mask is used to
 *               tailor how the various driver functions read their data.
 *               All of them are required to populate the metadata in the
 *               returned structures.  Ordinarily, they also read all of
 *               the "real" data.  If they honor the data read flag (see
 *               DBDataReadFlagHonored()), the user can set, by way of this
 *               function, the mask of "real" data to read.  This allows
 *               the user to decide not to read in the zonelist array of a
 *               UCD mesh, for instance, if he knows that it will not be
 *               useful to him (i.e. constant connectivity over a
 *               time-varying dataset.)
 *
 * Note: Many of these DBSet/Get routines DO NOT include the standard
 * API_BEGIN/API_END macros. This is primarily due to the fact that
 * these calls CANNOT fail. For others, that can fail, we do indeed
 * use the API_BEGIN/API_END macros as per instructions in
 * silo_private.h

 * Function:    DBShowErrors
 *
 * Purpose:     Set the method by which errors are displayed.  The
 *              `level' parameter is one of the following:
 *
 *                 DB_ALL       -- Show all errors, beginning with the
 *                                 routine that first detected the error
 *                                 and continuing up the call stack to
 *                                 the application.
 *
 *                 DB_ABORT     -- Same as DB_ALL except abort() is called
 *                                 after the error message is printed.
 *
 *                 DB_TOP       -- (default) Only the top-level API functions
 *                                 issue error messages.
 *
 *                 DB_NONE      -- The library does not handle error messages.
 *                                 The application is responsible for
 *                                 checking the API return values and
 *                                 handling the error.
 *
 *                 DB_SUSPEND   -- This is used internally to temporarily
 *                                 suspend the issuance of error messages
 *                                 by changing the error level to DB_NONE.
 *
 *                 DB_RESTORE   -- This is used internally to restore the
 *                                 previous error level after a DB_SUSPEND.
 *
 *              The `func' parameter can point to an application-level
 *              error handling function that will be passed a string that
 *              is part of the error message (similar to the argument for
 *              perror()).  If the function pointer is null, then
 *              the library will issue error messages to the standard
 *              error stream.
 *
 *              The error text and erring function name can
 *              be obtained by calling DBErrString() or DBErrFunc().
 *

 * Function:    DBForceSingle
 *
 * Purpose:     If 'status' is non-zero, then any 'datatype'd arrays are
 *              converted on read from whatever their native datatype is to
 *              float. A 'datatype'd array is an array that is part of some
 *              Silo object containing a 'datatype' member which indicates
 *              the type of data in the array. So, for example, a DBucdvar
 *              has a 'datatype' member to indicate the type of data in the
 *              var and mixvar arrays. Such arrays will be converted on read
 *              if 'status' here is non-zero. However, a DBmaterial object 
 *              is ALWAYS integer data. There is no 'datatype' member for
 *              such an object and so its data will NEVER be converted to
 *              float on read regardless of force single status set here.
 *
 *              I believe this function's original intention was to convert
 *              only double precision arrays to single precision. However,
 *              the PDB driver was apparently never designed that way and
 *              the PDB driver's behavior sort of established the defacto
 *              meaning of force single. So, now, as of Silo version 4.8
 *              the HDF5 driver obeys it as well. Though, in fact the HDF5
 *              driver was originally written to support the original
 *              intention of force single status and it worked in this
 *              ('buggy') fashion for many years before we started
 *              encountering real problems with it in VisIt.
 *
 * Return:      Success:        0 if all drivers succeeded or did not
 *                              implement this function.

 *  Routine                                                DBPutMatspecies
 *
 *  Purpose
 *
 *      Write a material species object into the open file.
 *
 *  Programmer
 *
 *      Al Leibee, B-DSAD
 *
 *  Notes
 *
 *      One zonal array ('speclist') is used which contains either:
 *      1) an index into the 'species_mf' array of the species mass fractions
 *         of a clean zone's material.
 *
 *                                  OR
 *      2) an index into the 'mix_speclist' array which contains an index
 *         into the 'species_mf' of the species mass fractions of a mixed
 *         zone's materials.
 *
 *  Modified
 *    Robb Matzke, Mon Nov 28 15:19:50 EST 1994
 *    Added device independence stuff.
 *
 *    Eric Brugger, Tue Feb  7 08:09:26 PST 1995
 *    I replaced API_END with API_END_NOPOP.
 *
 *    Sean Ahern, Tue Sep 28 10:48:06 PDT 1999
 *    Added a check for variable name validity.
 *
 *    Sean Ahern, Tue Sep 28 11:00:13 PDT 1999
 *    Made the error messages a little better.
 *
 *    Robb Matzke, 2000-05-23

 * Function:    db_ProcessOptlist
 *
 * Purpose:     Process the options list for an object and initializes the
 *              object's global data.  Each object type has its own global data
 *              so that `cycle' for one type of object is different from
 *              `cycle' for another type of object.  This results form trying
 *              to stay compatible with the previous version, where each
 *              object had its own source file with global variables
 *              declared `static'.
 *
 *              Some objects share the same global data.  They are:

 *  Made code that references DB_HDF5 conditionally compiled
 *
 *  Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 11 09:51:28 PST 2010
 *  Changed logic for how subtype is handled.
 *
 *  Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 25 19:00:09 PST 2010
 *  Versions of silo 4.7.2 and earlier used a bit of a brain dead way
 *  to specify alternative HDF5 vfds by manipulating the high order
 *  bits in the integer 'type' arg to DBCreate/DBOpen. For example, the
 *  default HDF5 driver was '7' while HDF5 w/STDIO vfd was '0x200'. This
 *  was inflexible and unable to handle the large variety of options
 *  available in HDF5.
 *
 *  Versions of silo newer than 4.7.2 use a global array of options
 *  sets registered and stored in the SILO_Globals structure. So,
 *  a particular set of HDF5 vfd options is identified by a single
 *  integer indexing into this global list of options. It is this integer
 *  index that is shifted left by 11 bits to make space for the primary
 *  Silo driver id (e.g. DB_PDB or DB_HDF5) and obsoleted HDF5 vfd
 *  specifications and then OR'd into the integer 'type' arg in the
 *  DBCreate/DBOpen calls to specify HDF5 vfd options.
 *
 *  In the initial implementation of this new approach using a global
 *  array of options sets, we allowed for a total of 32 (5 bits)
 *  options sets plus another 10 default options sets for convenience.
 *  But, we don't actually store the 10 default options set and use
 *  only the integer identifer between 0 and 9 to identify them.
 *  So, the identifier for a given options set ranges from 0...41
 *  requiring a total of 6 bits. Those 6 bits are 0x1F800.

|                    - double slashes (such as abc//123)
|                    - trailing slashes (such as abc/)

|                      some leading dots.
|                    - name-double dot sets (such as abc/../123)
|
|   Return:      A pointer to a NULL-terminated string is returned when this

 *
 * Programmer: Sean Ahern
 * Date: April 1999
 *
 * Input arguments:                                               
 *    s             The string to copy.
 *  
 * Global variables:
 *    None
 *      
 * Local variables:
 *    retval        The new string, with memory allocated.
