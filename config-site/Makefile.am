## Procss this file with automake to create Makefile.in

 
EXTRA_DIST = $(srcdir)/*.conf

#
# By default, the dist-gzip target (as well as other distribution
# targets) winds up creating copies of files that are really links
# instead of preserving the links. I did not find any ways to control
# the flags Automake uses to do the copy to, for example, ensure a
# '-d' was included in the 'cp' command to preserve links. I learned
# from reading AutoMake documentation that you can kinda-sorta do
# what you want by making special code in the 'dist-hook' target. So,
# we create that target here to ensure we wind up with a config-site
# dir where the links between config-site files are preserved. The
# code below is a based on code generated by Automake for the distdir
# target, but modified to handle this case.
#
# Due to substantial differences in controlling cp behavior with links
# between macOS and Linux, I added logic to disable attempts to produce
# distributions from macOS. Distribution files should be produced only
# from a Linux system.
