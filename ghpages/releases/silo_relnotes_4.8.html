<h1 style="text-align: center;">Announcing the release of version 4.8
of the Silo Library</h1>
<h2>This is the first, official BSD Licensed release of the Silo
Library!</h2>
<h2>Organization of information in this announcement</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Bugs fixed in this release.</li>
  <li>Performance-oriented features in this release.</li>
  <li>Other new features in this release.</li>
  <li>Important information regarding BSD vs. Legacy Licensed release
tarballs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Bugs fixed in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A bug where the Force Single behavior of the HDF5 driver was
resulting in all objects' arrays being converted to float but then
neglecting to set the associated 'datatype' member to DB_FLOAT was
corrected.</li>
  <li>A few cases where Silo was erroneously leaving HDF5 objects open
in a file, thereby causing the file itself to be left open in HDF5 even
after DBClose was called have been corrected.</li>
  <li>Some problems building Silo on windows with newer compilers and
with various configurations have been corrected. Thanks to Kathleen
Bonnell for these fixes as well as porting a number of code updates to
Windows and for laborious testing on Windows.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The silofile utility was re-written to NOT use magic file numbers
as that proved to be unreliable. Now the tool is much more robust at
identifying silo files as well as their underlying format (PDB or HDF5).</li>
  <li>A bug swapping the slash character in the filename part of
multi-block object block names when moving files between windows and
Linux was fixed. Thanks to Al Nichols for reporting the and the fix.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Leaks of optional species names and colors were corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Performance-oriented features in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To take advantage of some of the performance improvements described here,
      HDF5 Version 1.8.4 or newer is required.</li>
  <li>A number of options for using various Virtual File Drivers (VFDs)
that
come pre-packaged with the HDF5 library were added to Silo. The
interface to controlling these VFDs was enhanced. See documentation on
DBRegisterFileOptionsSet() in the Silo 4.8 user's manual for more
information. See <a href="https://wci-dev.llnl.gov/codes/silo/media/pdf/llnl_pres_428015.pdf">Overview of Silo block-based VFD</a>
and <a href="https://wci-dev.llnl.gov/codes/silo/media/pdf/llnl_pres_428059.pdf">Scaling Studies of Silo block-based VFD</a> for some details.<br>
  </li>
  <li>There is a new, Silo-specific VFD designed specifically for
BlueGene (e.g. BG/P and BG/Q) systems called the Silo block-based VFD.
Use of this VFD is essential for adequate performance on BG/P systems.
Thanks to Mike Collette and Richard Hedges for performing scaling
studies to help identify performance issues on BG/P. Read more about
this VFD and its options as well as a number of other VFDs and their
options in the Silo 4.8 User's manual.</li>
  <li>Silo can now optionally link with and use PDB Proper in <a
 href="https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/pact/">PACT</a> using the
--with-pdb-proper=<code>path-to-pact-libs</code> and 'DB_PDBP' for the
'type' argument in DBCreate/DBOopen calls. Thanks to Marty Marinak for
testing and Stewart Brown for guidance in implementing this feature.
This feature may be particularly important to codes using PDB driver on
BlueGene systems (e.g. BG/P) because the PDB Proper in <a
 href="https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/pact/">PACT</a> has undergone
substantial performance tuning for those systems.</li>
<li>A new I/O performance benchmarking tool, ioperf, was
added
to Silo tests. This tool can be useful in comparing performance of the
Poor Man's Parallel I/O strategy with any I/O library including sec2,
stdio, PDB, HDF5, Silo as well as any others a user might wish to write
plugins to test.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A new function, DBSortObjectsByOffset() was added that given a
list of object names an application wishes to read from a Silo file,
will return the order in which the named objects appear in the file.
This is useful in optimizing read operations from the file by
potentially minimizing the frequency/number of seeks as well as
improving efficiency of read-ahead.</li>
  <li>New options for using nameschemes instead of explicit lists of
names of blocks for multi-block objects were added. These options can
profoundly reduce the total size of multi-block objects as well as the
root files into which they are written as well as the I/O time to read
and write them.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A performance issue where HDF5 driver was constantly writing and
re-writing <span style="font-family: monospace;">cycle</span>,<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> time</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">dtime</span> for every DBPutXXX
operation was
corrected.</li>
  <li>A new friendly names option was added such that
HDF5 datasets are in fact written as their friendly
named variant in the current working directory instead of writing them
in the magic <span style="font-family: monospace;">/.silo</span>
directory with the friendly names being links to them. This may be 
important for scalability as the number of objects in the<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> /.silo</span> directory can otherwise
grow quite large causing possible performance issues for HDF5 to handle the
related metadata.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Other new features in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Note that Silo Version 4.8 is NOT link-time, backward compatible
with any previously released version. You will need to re-compile all code that includes
the Silo header file, silo.h.</li>
  <li>Silo is now officially released with a BSD Open source license.
Thanks to Eric Brugger for reviewing the approximately 150,000 lines of
code as well as the LLNL IM Team for completing the review and release
process.<br>
  </li>
  <li>There is a new, public, redmine bug tracker for Silo; <a
 href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov">https://visitbugs.ornl.gov</a>.
Thanks to Sean Ahern and Oak Ridge National Labs for hosting it and
thanks to Cyrus Harrison for setting it up. Before users can submit
requests there, you will be required to register and create an account.
But, that is a one-time operation. If you are already registered for
the VisIt tracker, then you can get the Silo tracker automatically.</li>
  <li>A significant reduction in compiler symbol table global namespace
clutter has been eliminated from Silo reducing possibility of symbol
collision when linking large applications.</li>
  <li>A new error reporting level was added, DB_ALL_AND_DRVR. This
level of error reporting is the same as DB_ALL except that it also
includes any additional error reporting from the underlying driver.</li>
  <li>Support for arrays of strings of variable length was added to a
number of functions in the Fortran interface that accept arrays of
strings. Thanks to Olivier Cessenat for this patch.</li>
  <li>DBPUTQV which accepts a multi-component quadvar was added to the
Fortran interface. Thanks to Olivier Cessenat for this implementation.</li>
  <li>A restriction on the number of components of a multi-component
ucdvar or quadvar was relaxed so that now, for example, DBPutUcdvar can
write a variable with 100 sub-variables.</li>
  <li>DBnamescheme objects now support references to external arrays of
string value.</li>
  <li>DBErrFunc was deprecated. Use DBErrFuncname now. Also, a new method,
      DBErrfunc was added to return the function pointer for the error
      function set in the last most-recent DBShowErrors() call.</li>
  <li>A new function, DBErrlvl, was added to return the error reporting level
set in the last, most-recent DBShowErrors() call.</li>
  <li>The test suite was enhanced substantially to run test on a variety of
      HDF5 virtual file drivers and library settings.</li>
  <li>Functions for catenating an array of strings into a single, semi-colon
separated string and the reverse operation were added to the public API. See
DBStringArrayToStringList and DBStringListToStringArray. These functions used
to be solely internal to Silo but have proven to be useful for Silo applications
needing to read and write arbitrary collections of strings.</li>
   <li>A new function, DBSetUnknownDriverPriorities was added to control the
behavior of the unknown (e.g. DB_UNKNOWN) driver when opening files of unspecified
low-level format type. Previously, the Silo library had a hard-coded sequence of
drivers it would try to open a file using DB_UNKNOWN driver type. Now, that sequence
can be specified by the Silo application.</li>
</ul>

Since  compression features  must be<br>explicitly turned on by a  Silo application, this impact can be easily<br>mitigating by  ensuring that Hzip and FPzip compression are  used only<br>for objects within Silo files not intended to be read by BSD releases.<br><br>For more  information on availability  of Hzip and  FPzip compression,<br>contact the developer, Peter Lindstrom, lindstrom2@llnl.gov.<br></pre>
