The [Silo](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo) project is maintained on GitHub.
Users needing support will need [a (free) GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) to create and comment on issues and discussions and to watch for new releases.

The **[Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository)** button on the [main Silo repository](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo) provides controls to opt in or out of various kinds of [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) including to just watch for releases **Watch**->**Custom**->**Only releases**.
Alternatively, if all you will ever care about is Silo release announcements and you do not want to get a GitHub account for that, you can [subscribe](mailto:listserv@listserv.llnl.gov?subject=subscribe%20silo-announce&body=subscribe%20silo-announce) to the `silo-announce` email list.
**Be sure to add your name** on the same line immediately after `subscribe silo-announce` in the body of the email before sending it.

A [GitHub Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo/discussions/new?category=q-a) is the preferred way to get help because it is likely to be seen by more people who can provide a timely response and because others who may encounter similar issues can benefit from any response(s) we produce.

For LLNL users who have matters requiring *special handling*, please follow the same procedure as for VisIt and use the unpublished VisIt email list.

In general, coverage is during normal West Coast business hours, 8am-12pm and 1-5pm (GMT-8, San Francisco time zone), Monday through Friday excluding [LLNL holidays](https://supplychain.llnl.gov/sites/supplychain/files/2024-03/llnl_holidays.pdf).
Response time may be as much as four hours due to team member’s multi-tasking among many responsibilities.
