The [Silo](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo) project is maintained on GitHub.
Users needing support will need [a (free) GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) to create and comment on issues and discussions and to watch for new releases.

The [**Watch**](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) button on the [main Silo repository](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo) provides controls to opt in or out of various kinds of [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) including to just watch for releases

A [GitHub Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/LLNL/Silo/discussions/new?category=q-a) is the preferred way to get help because it is likely to be seen by more people who can provide a timely response and because any response produced is likely to be a benefit to the widest possible audience.

For LLNL users who have matters requiring *special handling*, please follow the same procedure as for VisIt and use the unpublished VisIt email list.

In general, coverage is during normal West Coast business hours, 8am-12pm and 1-5pm (GMT-8, San Francisco time zone), Monday through Friday excluding [LLNL holidays](https://supplychain.llnl.gov/poattach/pdf/llnl_holidays.pdf).
Response time may be as much as four hours due to team memberâ€™s multi-tasking among many responsibilities.
